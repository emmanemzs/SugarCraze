# Sugar Craze

**Sugar Craze** is a fast-paced, interactive cake-matching game built using **ASP.NET Web Forms**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Players are challenged to match a randomized goal cake by selecting the correct base, icing, topping, and border. The objective is to complete as many correct cakes as possible within a one-minute timer.

All visual assets, branding, and UI were custom-designed using **Photoshop**, **Illustrator**, and **Figma**.
